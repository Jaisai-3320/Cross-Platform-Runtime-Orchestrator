# Cross-Platform-Runtime-Orchestrator
A lightweight, multi-tenant runtime that embeds V8 (and optionally Node.js) to execute TypeScript/JavaScript apps across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Includes process isolation via per-tenant V8 Isolates, a simple scheduler, Chromium DevTools Protocol (via V8 Inspector) for live debugging, and Win32-specific thread scheduling optimizations.
